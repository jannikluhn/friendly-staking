    Staking in a traditional pool is like heroin: It feels extraordinarily pleasent, but it's not
    the most healthy for yourself and your environment.

    Home staking is like doing Yoga every morning at sunrise: Amazing if you can pull it off, but
    beyond the capabilities of mere mortals.

    With Friendly Staking, you band together with your friends to achieve the best of both worlds:
    The ease of traditional staking pools, at yields only home staking could give you before, plus
    the good feeling of personally doing your part in securing the network. Only one of you has to
    run a physical node (but one of you probably does already).
