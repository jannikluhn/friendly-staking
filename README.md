Home staking is like doing yoga every morning at sunrise: Amazing if you can pull it off, but beyond the capabilities of mere mortals.

With Friendly Staking, you can have the best of woth worlds: The ease of traditional staking pools, at yields only home staking could give you before, plus the good feeling of personally doing your part in securing the network. How? By banding together with your friends. Everyone provides a share of the stake, but only one has to run a physical node.
